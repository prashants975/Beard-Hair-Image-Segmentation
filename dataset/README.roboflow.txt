The dataset includes 745 images.
Hair are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -20 and +20 degrees
* Random shear of between -7째 to +7째 horizontally and -7째 to +7째 vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 3 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random rotation of between -3 and +3 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
